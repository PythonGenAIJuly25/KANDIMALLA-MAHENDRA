Test with different lists.\n","\n","### Assignment 11: Filter Function\n","\n","Use the filter function to filter out all odd numbers from a list of integers. Test with different lists.\n","\n","### Assignment 12: Function Decorator\n","\n","Define a decorator function that prints 'Executing function...' before executing a function and 'Function executed.' after executing it. Apply this decorator to a function that takes a list of integers and returns their sum. Test the decorated function with different lists.\n","\n","### Assignment 13: Function with *args and **kwargs\n","\n","Define a function that takes variable-length arguments and keyword arguments and prints them. Test the function with different inputs.\n","\n","### Assignment 14: Higher-Order Function\n","\n","Define a higher-order function that takes a function and a list of integers as arguments, and applies the function to each integer in the list. Test with different functions and lists.\n","\n","### Assignment 15: Function Documentation\n","\n","Define a function with a docstring that explains what the function does, its parameters, and its return value. Print the function's docstring."],"id":"X7OFwUoJOQWE"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ODFfnriLOQWL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1752769944989,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":77,"user":{"displayName":"kandimalla mahendra","userId":"12460731756967501207"}},"outputId":"f0925d5a-5d50-4feb-e085-aa0cc85887e3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["4\n","25\n"]}],"source":["# Assignment 1: Define a function that takes a single integer as input and returns its square.
